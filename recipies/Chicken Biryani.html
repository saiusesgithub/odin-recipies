    <p>Chicken biryani is a flavorful and aromatic mixed rice dish that originates from the Indian subcontinent. It's a culinary masterpiece where succulent pieces of marinated chicken are layered with fragrant basmati rice, caramelized onions, mint, coriander, and a blend of aromatic spices like saffron, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. The dish is often slow-cooked, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully, resulting in tender chicken and fragrant, fluffy rice.</p>

    <p>Each region in India boasts its own unique take on this beloved dish, with variations in spices, cooking techniques, and additional ingredients like potatoes or eggs. Whether it's the Hyderabadi kacchi biryani (where raw marinated meat is layered with rice) or the Lucknowi dum biryani (slow-cooked over low heat), chicken biryani is a celebration of flavors and textures, making it a popular choice for special occasions and everyday indulgence alike.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Basmati Rice</li>
        <li>yogurt</li>
        <li>onions</li>
        <li>ginger garlic paste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>

    
    

    <li>Marinate the Chicken: Mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and your chosen spices (like turmeric, chili powder, coriander, cumin, garam masala, and salt). Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or longer for deeper flavor.</li>
    <li>Prepare the Rice: Wash and soak the basmati rice for about 20-30 minutes. Then, partially cook the rice in boiling water with some whole spices (like bay leaf, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves) and a little salt until it's about 70% done. Drain the water.</li>
    <li>Layer and Assemble: In a heavy-bottomed pot, create layers. Start with a layer of the partially cooked rice, then a layer of the marinated chicken. You can also add fried onions, chopped mint, and coriander at this stage. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of rice. Sprinkle saffron milk (saffron soaked in warm milk) over the top for color and aroma.</li>
    <li>Cook on Low Heat (Dum): Cover the pot tightly with a lid to trap the steam. Cook on very low heat (this is called "dum") for about 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the chicken is tender. Let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
